# Analysis of District-Wide Standardized Test Results

## Introduction

As the newly appointed Chief Data Scientist for our city's school district, my primary task was to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. The objective was to identify trends in school performance to assist the school board and mayor in making informed decisions about future school budgets and priorities. This README presents the key findings from the analysis, focusing on school budgets, school sizes, and school types.

## Data Overview

The dataset provided includes standardized test results for 39,170 students attending 15 schools within our city's school district. The dataset contains math and reading scores for each student, along with information about the schools they attend. Additionally, the total budget for all 15 schools amounts to $24 million, with different budgets allocated per student. The schools are classified into two types: district and charter schools.

## Analysis and Findings

1. **School Budget vs. Test Performance**

   Contrary to common beliefs, the analysis revealed that schools with higher budgets per student did not necessarily achieve better test results. In fact, schools with budgets ranging from $645 to $675 per student exhibited lower performance compared to schools with smaller budgets, approximately $585 per student.

   **Recommendation:** Further investigation is necessary to understand why schools with higher budgets are not yielding improved outcomes. This may involve scrutinizing the allocation and utilization of additional funds to enhance the learning environment effectively.

2. **School Size and Math Performance**

   The analysis demonstrated a clear correlation between school size and math performance. Smaller and medium-sized schools consistently outperformed larger schools in terms of the percentage of students passing math tests. Passing rates for math in smaller and medium-sized schools ranged from 89% to 91%, whereas larger schools only achieved a 67% passing rate.

   **Recommendation:** To enhance overall math performance, the school district should focus on maintaining smaller class sizes and creating a conducive learning environment in larger schools.

3. **Charter Schools vs. District Schools**

   Charter schools outperformed district schools across all performance metrics. However, further investigation is required to determine whether this is due to the practices implemented within charter schools or the fact that they typically serve smaller student populations.

   **Recommendation:** A comprehensive analysis of teaching methods, curriculum, and school management practices in both charter and district schools is necessary to identify the key factors contributing to the higher performance of charter schools. This information can then be used to improve practices within district schools.

## Conclusion

The analysis of the district-wide standardized test results provides valuable insights into school performance. Surprisingly, higher budgets did not translate to improved test results, while smaller and medium-sized schools demonstrated significantly better math performance. Additionally, charter schools outperformed district schools, warranting further investigation.

As the Chief Data Scientist, I will continue conducting in-depth analyses to identify the root causes of these trends and develop data-driven strategies to enhance educational outcomes in our city's school district. These findings will serve as a foundation for the school board and mayor to make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities, ultimately benefiting the students and the community as a whole.
